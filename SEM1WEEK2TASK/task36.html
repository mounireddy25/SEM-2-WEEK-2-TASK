    <h1>AVENGERS</h1>
     <p>In the Battleworld domain of Spider-Island, the Avengers were taken over by the same spider-virus turning them into Man-Spiders that obeyed the Spider-Queen's every command. It took a combination of Man-Wolf's gemstone, Morbius the Living Vampire's serum, the Lizard serum, and the Goblin formula to free some of the Avengers. </p>
     <p class="one">After the Spider-Queen was defeated, Spider-Island is now a domain filled with Man-Spiders, Dinosaur People, Lizard People, Bird People, Vampires, and Werewolves.</p>
      <p class="two">In the Battleworld domain of the Regency, Hawkeye has kept the Avengers alive in S.H.I.E.L.D. after most of its members and other known superheroes were defeated by Regent.</p>
